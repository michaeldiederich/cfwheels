This release finalizes the 2.3.0 release and doesn't include any new enhancements or bug fixes. Below is the change log from the 2.3.0.rc.1 release.

- Handle XSS Injection in development environment - [Michael Diederich]
- Fix params bug in CLI API [#1106] - [Peter Amiri]

### Miscellaneous

- Update Docker Lucee Commandbox version to 5.2.0 - [Adam Chapman, Tom King]

- Minor visual fix for long migration logs overflow in modal (scroll) - [Brian Ramsey]
- Add test suite for Lucee and H2 Database to the GitHub Actions test suite. - [Peter Amiri]
- On going changes to update the H2 drivers [#1107] - [Peter Amiri]
- Fixes some syntax formatting introduced by cfformat [#1111] - [Adam Chapman]

### Potentially Breaking Changes

- Automatic Time Stamps: the **deletedAt** column was using the server's local time for the timestamp while **createdAt** / **updatedAt** were using the timestamp selected for the timestamp mode. The default for CFWheels' timestamp mode is UTC and therefore all future **deletedAt** timestamps will be in UTC unless you've changed the default.  Please review any SQL that uses **deletedAt** for datetime comparison.

<a name="2.1.0-beta"></a>

# [2.1.0-Beta](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/releases/tag/v2.1.0-beta) => 2020.02.24

### Potentially Breaking Changes

- The new CFWheels internal GUI is more isolated and runs in it's own component: previously this was extending the developers main `Controller.cfc` which caused multiple issues. The migrator, test runner and routing GUIs have therefore all been re-written.
- The plugins system behaviour no longer chains multiple functions of the same name as this was a major performance hit. It's recommended that plugin authors check their plugins to run on 2.1
- HTTP Verb/Method switching is now no longer allowed via GET requests and must be performed via POST (i.e via `_method`)

- Allow createdAt and updatedAt to be explicitly assigned using the `allowExplicitTimestamps=true` argument - [#887](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/887) - [Adam Chapman]

### Controller Enhancements

- New `set(flashAppend=true)` option allows for appending of a Flash key instead of replacing - [#855](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/pull/855) - [Tom King]
- `flashMessages()` now checks for an array of strings or just a string and outputs appropriately - [#855](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/pull/855) - [Tom King]
- `flashInsert()` can now accept a one dimensional array - [#855](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/pull/855) - [Tom King]

### Bug Fixes

- Calculated properties can now override an existing property - [#764](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/764) [Adam Chapman, Andy Bellenie]
- Filters are now correctly called if there is more than one after filter - [#853](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/853) [Brandon Shea, Tom King, Adam Chapman]

- Convert `handle` to a valid variable name so it doesn't break when using dot notation - [#846](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/846) [Per Djurner]

- `validatesConfirmationOf()` now has a `caseSensitive` argument to optionally perform a case sensitive comparison - [#918](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/918) [Tom King]
- `sendFile()` no longer expands an already expanded directory on ACF2016 - [#873](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/873) [David Paul Belanger, Tom King, strubenstein]
- Automatic database migrations onApplicationStart now correctly reference appropriate Application scope - [#870](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/870) [Tom King]
- `usesLayout()` now can be called more than once and properly respects the order called - [#891](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/891) [David Paul Belanger]
- Migrator MSSQL adapter now respects `Time` and `Timestamp` Column Types - [#906](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/906) [Reuben Brown]
